# HTTP Client Game Service

This is an Adapter for the Domain's `GameService` Port that provides an implementation backed by our remote API (see `/app/api`).

This could be used as a drop-in replacement in the React SPA to allow us to play a game that is held on a remote server rather than being in meory in the browser.
